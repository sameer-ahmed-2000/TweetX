##Technology Stack:

###MERN Stack: Chose MongoDB for its flexibility with schema-less data storage, Express.js for building robust APIs, React for its component-based architecture and rich ecosystem of libraries, and Node.js for its efficient handling of backend operations, ensuring a cohesive and scalable application architecture.
State Management with Recoil:

###Recoil: Opted for Recoil due to its simplicity and ability to manage complex state logic across components. Recoil's atoms and selectors allowed for efficient and predictable state management, improving code readability and maintainability.
Styling Approach with Tailwind CSS:

###Tailwind CSS: Selected Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid UI development without sacrificing customization. Tailwind's extensive set of utility classes facilitated consistent and responsive design across the application, promoting a streamlined development process.
Utilization of Hooks and Custom Hooks:

###Hooks: Leveraged React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext extensively to manage component-level state, side effects, and context sharing within the application. Custom hooks were developed to encapsulate complex logic and promote code reuse across multiple components, enhancing code modularity and scalability.
##Backend API Development:

###Backend Development: Created a RESTful API using Express.js and Node.js to handle data retrieval, storage, and manipulation operations. Implemented middleware for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to endpoints and data integrity.
